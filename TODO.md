# Bugs
- [ ] Adding "required" field to errored fields makes the fields look weird when they have the "$" and "USD" stuff in them. (see new show form, submit a section with no pricing)
- [ ] Update merch, add category but don't fill anything in then save. Should pass validation but doesn't
- [ ] You can uncheck the "All" chip
- [ ] Order form not validating address properly
- [ ] Deleting an existing seat on an existing seating chart does nothing
- [ ] Ticket types form - convenience fee error messages are not styled properly
- [ ] Removing a section on the seating chart form closes the slideout
- [ ] Rapidly clicking the trash can on the shopping cart dropdown will eventually result in a 404 which replaces the shopping cart with "No content"

- Outstanding merch orders screen
- Shipped button on Merch
